# dctm-brownbag's project

The project introduces various documentum related projects I recently had to
work on and that resulted in the creation of java programs.

The projects included here were selected because they illustrate interesting
properties of the Documentum server.

The first one, [bad-contents-lister](https://github.com/thebluemountain/dctm-brownbag/bad-contents-lister)
provides some information about the way Documentum server resolves contents into files.

Enjoy your reading.
